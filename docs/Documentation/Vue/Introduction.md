# Introduction

## Composing with Components

The component system is another important concept in Vue, because it’s an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components. If we think about it, almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components:

**In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance** with pre-defined options. Registering a component in Vue is straightforward:

在Vue中，一个组件实际上是一个有pre-defined options的Vue实例

```javascript
// Define a new component called todo-item
Vue.component('todo-item', {
  template: '<li>This is a todo</li>'
})

var app = new Vue(...)
```

Now you can compose it in another component’s template:

```javascript
<ol>
  <!-- Create an instance of the todo-item component -->
  <todo-item></todo-item>
</ol>
```

But this would render the same text for every todo, which is not super interesting. We should be able to **pass data from the parent scope into child components**. Let’s modify the component definition to make it accept a [prop](components.html#Props):

```javascript
Vue.component('todo-item', {
  // The todo-item component now accepts a "prop", which is like a custom attribute.
  // This prop is called todo.
  props: ['todo'],
  template: '<li>{{ todo.text }}</li>'
})
```

Now we can pass the todo into each repeated component using `v-bind`:

```javascript
<div id="app-7">
  <ol>
    <!--
      Now we provide each todo-item with the todo object it's representing, so that its content can be dynamic.
      We also need to provide each component with a "key",
      which will be explained later.
    -->
    <todo-item
      v-for="item in groceryList"
      v-bind:todo="item"
      v-bind:key="item.id"
    ></todo-item>
  </ol>
</div>

Vue.component('todo-item', {
  props: ['todo'],
  template: '<li>{{ todo.text }}</li>'
})

var app7 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-7',
  data: {
    groceryList: [
      { id: 0, text: 'Vegetables' },
      { id: 1, text: 'Cheese' },
      { id: 2, text: 'Whatever else humans are supposed to eat' }
    ]
  }
})
```

This is a contrived example, but we have managed to separate our app into two smaller units, and the child is reasonably well-decoupled from the parent via the props interface. We can now further improve our `<todo-item>` component with more complex template and logic without affecting the parent app.

In a large application, it is necessary to divide the whole app into components to make development manageable. We will talk a lot more about components [later in the guide](components.html), but here’s an (imaginary) example of what an app’s template might look like with components:

```
<div id="app">
  <app-nav></app-nav>
  <app-view>
    <app-sidebar></app-sidebar>
    <app-content></app-content>
  </app-view>
</div>
```

### Relation to Custom Elements

You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to **Custom Elements**, which are part of the [Web Components Spec](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebComponents/). That’s because Vue’s component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec. For example, Vue components implement the [Slot API](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Slots-Proposal.md) and the `is` special attribute. However, there are a few key differences:

1. The Web Components Spec has been finalized, but is not natively implemented in every browser. Safari 10.1+, Chrome 54+ and Firefox 63+ natively support web components. In comparison, Vue components don’t require any polyfills and work consistently in all supported browsers (IE9 and above). When needed, Vue components can also be wrapped inside a native custom element.
2. Vue components provide important features that are not available in plain custom elements, most notably cross-component data flow, custom event communication and build tool integrations.

Although Vue doesn’t use custom elements internally, it has [great interoperability](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#vue) when it comes to consuming or distributing as custom elements. Vue CLI also supports building Vue components that register themselves as native custom elements.
